# Manually Boot Clusters

Use Tectonic Installer to easily set up and configure a cluster, then download the cluster's assets. Once downloaded, use the command line to reference these assets, and manually deploy clusters.

This process may be used to create multiple clusters with similar configurations, to deploy a single cluster multiple times, or to quickly generate cluster templates for distribution to your team.

Assets generated by Tectonic Installer allow you to make changes to the underlying infrastructure for a cluster. They do not provide support for changes to Kubernetes manifests, or to Tectonic components run in the cluster (such as etcd or clair).

Downloaded assets are also required to destroy existing clusters, once they have been deployed.

## Generate and download cluster assets

First, use Tectonic Installer to generate and download cluster assets. Walk through the Installer to configure the cluster, then click *Download assets* from the *Start Installation* screen.

## Initialize Terraform

Follow the instructions to [initialize and configure Terraform][initialize-tf].

## Use assets.zip to customize your deployment

I would add how to 1) navigate to the folder 2) make two or three edits, to address commonly requested changes, then 3) save the work out for use in deployment.

## Deploy the cluster

Once customized, use `terraform plan` to test your deployment, then `terraform apply` to deploy your cluster.

```
$ terraform plan -var-file=build/${CLUSTER}/terraform.tfvars platforms/aws
$ terraform apply -var-file=build/${CLUSTER}/terraform.tfvars platforms/aws
```

When complete, your Tectonic cluster will be ready for access.

## Access the cluster

Tectonic Console will be running after the containers have downloaded. Access Console at the DNS name configured in your variables file.

Inside of the `/generated` folder you should find any credentials, including the CA if generated, and a kubeconfig. You can use this to control the cluster with kubectl:
```
$ export KUBECONFIG=generated/auth/kubeconfig
$ kubectl cluster-info
```

## Destroy existing clusters

assets.zip also includes `terraform.tfstate`, which is necessary to destroy existing clusters. For more information on using Terraform to destroy existing clusters, see [Uninstall Tectonic][uninstall].
