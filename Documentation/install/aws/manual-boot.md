# Manually boot clusters with Terraform

The Tectonic Installer can be used to easily create Terraform assets and configuration files used to provision a Tectonic cluster via the terminal.

This process may be used to create multiple clusters with similar configurations, to deploy a single cluster multiple times, or to quickly generate cluster templates for distribution to your team.

Assets generated by Tectonic Installer allow you to make changes to the underlying infrastructure for a cluster. They do not provide support for changes to Kubernetes manifests, nor to Tectonic components run in the cluster (such as etcd or clair).

These downloaded assets are also necessary to destroy existing clusters, once they have been deployed.

## Generate and download cluster assets

First, use Tectonic Installer to generate and download cluster assets.

* Walk through the Installer in your browser, entering credentials and cluster information as usual.
* On the *Start Installation* screen, click *Download assets* to download the Terraform files to your local machine.

## Initialize Terraform

Follow the instructions to [initialize and configure Terraform][initialize-tf].

## Use assets.zip to customize your deployment

In the `tectonic` installer assets directory you configured in the previous step, unzip the `assets.zip` archive and navigate to the folder created.

```bash
$ unzip assets.zip # creates `my-cluster_2017_05_15-13-31`
$ cd my-cluster_2017_05_15-13-31
$ ls
config.tf        license.txt      logs             modules          platforms        pull_secret.json terraform.tfvars
```

Then, edit `terraform.tfvars` to customize your deployment. For example, to create two matching clusters in two different regions, edit one node's `tectonic_aws_region` value to set it to a different region, then edit the `tectonic_worker_count` value appropriately.

## Deploy the cluster

Once customized, use `terraform plan` to test your deployment, then `terraform apply` to deploy your cluster.

```bash
$ terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars platforms/aws
$ terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars platforms/aws
```

If you're having problems at this step, make sure you've [configured Terraform][initialize-tf] correctly. If you continue to have problems, check out the [Troubleshooting Tectonic Installer FAQ][faq].

When complete, your Tectonic cluster will be ready for access.

## Access the cluster

Tectonic Console will be running after the containers have downloaded. Access Console at the DNS name configured in your variables file.

Inside of the `generated/` folder you should find any credentials, including the CA if generated, and a kubeconfig. You can use this to control the cluster with kubectl:

```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=generated/auth/kubeconfig
$ kubectl cluster-info
```

## Destroy existing clusters

assets.zip also includes `terraform.tfstate`, which is necessary to destroy existing clusters. For more information on using Terraform to destroy existing clusters, see [Uninstall Tectonic][uninstall].
